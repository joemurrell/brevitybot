As missiles guide by creating a direct intercept course, this is also used to reduce the missile's speed and thus its ability to maneuver if radar lock is maintained. Can also be used in the context of submarine warfare as a maneuverer to leave the sonar detection cone of an incoming torpedo before it closes the distance required to detect and lock onto the notching vessel."
